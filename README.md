### Why Code Control? ###
 - **Uses QR Codes** to access keys.
 - **Criptography assimetric** it provides authenticity and confidentiality in QR Codes. The QR Codes are encrypted before generated.
 - **Interface JavaFX** 
 - **Open-source** to improve the system.
 - **Arduino** to unlock the door.

### Vulnerabilities? ###
 - **Ethernet atacks** Attacks on data ranging from computer to the Arduino via ethernet cable.
 - **Social engineering** using QR Codes from other users.
